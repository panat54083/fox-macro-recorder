## Tips & Tricks

**🦊 Clever Fox Tip**: Make sure the page layout stays the same between recording and playback for best results. If the page scrolls or elements move, coordinates may not match.

**🎯 Accuracy**: For best accuracy, record at the same browser zoom level you'll use for playback.

**⏱️ Timing**: If a website is slow, the original timing might not be enough. Re-record during slower conditions for better results.

**📦 Organize**: Use descriptive names and domains for your macros. The domain is auto-detected, but you can edit it to group macros however you like.

## Technical Details

- **Manifest Version**: 3 (Latest Chrome Extension standard)
- **Permissions**: Storage only (to save your macros)
- **Works On**: All URLs (you choose where to use it)
- **Storage**: Chrome local storage API

## Chrome Web Store Submission

### Single Purpose Statement
**Record and replay mouse click sequences on web pages to automate repetitive clicking tasks.**

### Privacy & Permissions Justification

**Permissions Requested:**
1. **`storage`** - Required to save user-recorded macros locally in the browser's storage. Users can create, save, and manage multiple macros that persist across browser sessions.

2. **Content Script on `<all_urls>`** - The content script must run on all websites because users need to record and replay clicks on any webpage they choose. The extension cannot predict which sites users will automate, so it must be available everywhere. The content script only activates when users explicitly show the panel.

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- ✅ All data stored locally in browser (chrome.storage.local)
- ✅ No external servers or network connections
- ✅ No data collection, tracking, or analytics
- ✅ No user data sharing or transmission
- ✅ Content script is passive until user activates it
- ✅ Panel hidden by default to avoid interference

**Remote Code:**
- ❌ **NO remote code used** - All code is packaged within the extension
- ❌ No external scripts loaded from CDNs or remote servers
- ❌ No code execution from external sources
- ✅ Completely self-contained and reviewable

### Privacy Policy

**Required:** Chrome Web Store requires a publicly accessible privacy policy URL.

**Privacy Policy Location:** See [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for the full privacy policy.

**For Chrome Web Store Submission:**
You need to host this privacy policy at a publicly accessible URL. Options:
1. **GitHub (Recommended):** If your repository is public, use:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fox-macro-recorder/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md
   ```
2. **GitHub Pages:** Host it as a webpage
3. **Your Website:** Upload to your personal/company website
4. **Google Docs:** Create a public Google Doc with the privacy policy

**Key Points:**
- ✅ We only store data locally (no transmission)
- ✅ No personal information collected
- ✅ No third-party services or analytics
- ✅ Users have full control over their data
